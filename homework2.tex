\section{Regular language}
L is a regular language, therefore one of the following 4 cases is true. Each of
those cases can ensure End(L, a) is a regular language.

\subsection{if L == \{\}}
$End(L, a) = \{\} \implies End(L, a)$ is a regular language.

\subsection{if L == \{``"\}}
$End(L, a) = \{\} \implies End(L, a)$ is a regular language.

\subsection{if L == \{``x"\}}
One of the following 2 cases is true, each of which ensures End(L, a) is a
regular language.

\subsubsection{if x == a}
$End(L, a) = \{a\} \implies End(L, a)$ is a regular language.

\subsubsection{if x != a}
$End(L, a) = \{\} \implies End(L, a)$ is a regular language.

\subsection{if L is generated from 2 regular languages A and B}
One of the following 3 cases is true, each of which ensures End(L, a) is a
regular language according to structual induction with assumptions End(A, a) and
End(B, a) are regular languages.

\subsubsection{$if L == A \cup B$}
$End(L, a) = End(A \cup B, a) = End(A, a) \cup End(B, a) \implies End(L, a)$ is
a regular language.

\subsubsection{$if L == A B$}
$End(L, a) = End(A B, a) = A End(B, a) \implies End(L, a)$ is a regular
language.

\subsubsection{$if L == A^*$}
$End(L, a) = End(A^*, a) = A^* End(A, a) \implies End(L, a)$ is a regular
language.

\section{Regular expression}
Define $A = (aa + bbb)^* c$. Obviously A is a regular language. Therefore,
\[L = A^* \implies End(L, a)
= A^* End(A, a)
= A^* End((aa + bbb)^* c, a)
= A^*\{\} = \{\}
\]

\section{Regular language}
L is a regular language, therefore one of the following 3 cases is true. Each of
those cases can ensure $L^r$ is a regular language.

\subsection{if L == \{\}}
$L^r = \{\} \implies L^r$ is a regular language.

\subsection{if L == \{``"\}}
$L^r = \{``"\} \implies End(L, a)$ is a regular language.

\subsection{if L == \{x\}}
$L^r = \{x\} \implies L^r$ is a regular language.

\subsection{if L is generated from 2 regular languages A and B}
One of the following 3 cases is true, each of which ensures $L^r$ is a
regular language according to structual induction with assumptions $A^r$ and
$B^r$ are regular languages.

\subsubsection{$if L == A \cup B$}
$L^r = (A \cup B)^r = A^r \cup B^r \implies L^r$ is a regular language.

\subsubsection{$if L == A B$}
$L^r = (A B)^r = B^r A^r \implies L^r$ is a regular language.

\subsubsection{$if L == A^*$}
$L^r = (A^*)^r = (A^r)^* \implies L^r$ is a regular language.

\section{Regular expression}
$(((aa + bbb)^*c)^*bc)^r = cb(c(aa + bbb)^*)^*$
